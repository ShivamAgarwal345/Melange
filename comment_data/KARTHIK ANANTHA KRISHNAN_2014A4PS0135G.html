I was sad about something and you sat near me and consoled me even though you knew little about me at that time. That was so generous and kind of you. And called me at home when we had vacation. Those are all traits which distinguish you from the rest. I used to trust you a lot(whether you kept it or not is another question :P, jk!). Anyway thanks for all the wonderful memories. Stay in touch :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>"Yo man" PS1 buddies and mech buddies!

After that our friendship has seen only a positive slope. I'll never forget the time when you're placements were going on. That was the time I realised how important you were to me and how desperate I was to see you get placed. Don't take too much pressure bro, all the hardwork that you've done will not go waste. I really believe in you. You are certainly going to be exceptional. Always by your side. and yeah All the best with Geethu :) Cheers!

I admire how much you value relationships and how driven you are to achieve your goals. The fact that you buy me chocolates automatically makes you my favourite person on campus.   It's amazing how you put up with my 2am rants, the scornful comments and the ruthless mockery.  Thanks for being my go to person and my sounding board.

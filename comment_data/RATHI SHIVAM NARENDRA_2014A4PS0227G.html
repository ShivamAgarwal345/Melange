(There was another person with us if you remember, but that friendship was extremely short lived). I think our differences clearly outweigh our similarities by at least a factor of 10. But is it always the similarity in thought that results in a strong bonding? No. It is how we respect the other persons views even if we don't concur with them. And that is what I like about our friendship. I won't delve into our journey at BITS, the ups and downs. Both of us have discussed about it quite a few times. What I would mention, rather, is that I have learnt innumerable things from you. Your ability to ace almost anything you put your heart to, the way you manage your belongings, your mobile, your laptop, your room etc. Maine pehle bahut bada likha tha but it was not accepting. So I'll stop here. Don't know when our paths will coincide again but wherever we are, whenever you need me always remember that your brother from another mother is just a call away. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ANAND Dugad<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Rathi is the most sleep loving person I know. Rathi, the horror movie screenings in 118, your fluency in cracking particular kind of jokes, your last minute panicking irrespective of the preparation level before the exams and acing all the exams, your seat on the 2nd row in mech class, lights off at 10.00 pm every night (sometimes even before that) and your importance of gym workout will always be remembered. Best of luck for all the things that you will do in your future. I am sure that you will become the very best in whatever you do.

Thats how we rolled. My mythology class during waves, Our sleeping on single bed nights and every conversation where I bashed Mechanical and you bashed my thoughts about certain things! I hope we stay the same, and we talk openly about everything as we did! Countries apart, I will try my best to boost your confidence in my favourite sector! :p All The BEST, my friend!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...VARAD JOSHI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>GOD.

Your organisation skills, your regulated routine and your hardworking nature has motivated me to double the work that I would have done in BITS. Needless to say your sense of humour is amazing, your ability to think of such quirky jokes with such ease amazes me every time! Your friendship has taught me a lot of things, and it has certainly made my life way more entertaining! :D May our companies be merged someday and ill give you 49% of the share :P Best of luck!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Soham Kelkar<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Inspite of our approach towards life being so contrast, those mechanical CDCs (whichever i attended :p) would have been unbearable.

You were, are and always will be an inspiration to me. Attending all mech classes, you motivated me to attend them even if I was running 45minutes late ;p. You are a disciplined and a talented person. I will always remember our talks on life, you coming to my door before every exam and saying "bohot fatt rahi hai yaar" and then acing the exam, we hitting Murthy and doing stuff to Ameya. Keep working hard and jab bandi mile toh mujhe sabse pehle call karna.

But I'll stick to the essentials, learning your no-nonsense attitude and remarkable focus on what matters most. Never have I seen someone who treasures their sleep as you do, and yet makes everything work out. And though we disagree on a topic or two, it's been great to have a sparring partner, mechanical guru, warm host, eager tourist and, most of all, close friend, right next door. Thanks for making my time at AH-1 so much fun. Given how many properties you have in Mumbai, I don't have to worry about you going elsewhere or falling out of touch. Keep acing it ;-)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NISSIM GORE-DATAR<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>We don't go back a long way but whatever I have known about you and been with you it has been a beautiful time. You have MOST stupid sense of humor, your lame jokes and your tana either makes me want to kill you or laugh my heart out; both of which are entertaining in their ways.   Here's hoping to new beginnings and new journeys in your life. Keeping everything old behind... All the very best Alwin.  </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SAPTADWIPA GANGULY<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Hi Alwin, It was nice knowing you.

The calmness with which you handle the most Difficult situations (You know which ones :P) is really something to learn from. I really think they should make you the Head for one of the Labs, you take the chillest and best lab sessions. But, Mana kar dena :D. Wish you great success in all your future endeavours.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Adjay Sagar S<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Bro thanks for making the lab sessions lite for us.

<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Hi Dude! Thanks for being so cool. I haven't met anyone like you, and I am sure I will never meet anyone like you. You are a gem. I still miss all the weird conversations that we used to have, and the movies, of course. Let's climb the terrace again? I wish we could rewind, I would have made up for all the lost time. Anyway.. let's plan a trip? And, i am really happy that I got to stay in your room. I will never forget the moment you swore at the breakfast table. It sounded so cute :P Always be the same. Because those who dare ask you to change will have burnt hair. I PROMISE. I know we will stay in touch :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SAKSHI MEHRA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Phenomenal human being to have the insanely perverted/hilarious conversations of life.

You were one of the best things that happened to me in college and I can't wait for us to share with each other all our new experiences as we get older! We'll continue to make silly pacts and be the same powerpuff girls as our first year, always!

I really don't know what to say here. You're hard to pen down to a single set of qualities, people or memories, and I guess that's what's best about you. I've always admired your spontaneity and fearless go-getter attitude, whether it's with the boyz, the booze or the bytes. I don't think it's any use telling you not to change; you're going to do your own thing anyway, and, as ever, you'll ace it. May the odds be ever in your favour. :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NISSIM GORE-DATAR<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Early realisation but late initiation in getting to know you.

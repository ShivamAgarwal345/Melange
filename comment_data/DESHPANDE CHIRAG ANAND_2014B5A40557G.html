One of the best end-game players in AoE, awesome badminton player (tere bolne se to lagta hai aise :P), quality all rounder in cricket and above all one of the best carrom players I have seen. You seem to be pocketing every damn milestone just like those coins in carrom. All you need is a bit of cover when you go behind the rani ;) I'm there for that :P. But jokes apart, you are one of the most sincere and hard working people. No wonder you are able to top in both degrees of yours. Oh, and how can I forget. Perfect teacher of any automobile. Bike sikhaane ke liye dahe dil se shukriyaa. Insha'Allah US mein milenge. Keep acing in everything.

Don't worry, the business plan won't be forgotten - the funding is going to come from your hospital, remember? I suspect we'd stay in touch anyway, given our propensity for professional intersection and synchronized administrative hurdles. Good luck, and stop feigning pessimism about your future.

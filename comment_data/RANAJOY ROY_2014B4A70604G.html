It's always great talking to you, the plethora of random questions we ask each other, the way we dissect anything and everything under the sun, or the way we gang up against Som :P. In fact, every time we meet up, we get so engaged in our conversations that they go on for hours without either one's noticing. I do hope you survive CS (:P) and end up doing something you truly enjoy. Take care. PS: I think I have mentioned this earlier, but I love your "accent"!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SWATI SHIKHA .<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

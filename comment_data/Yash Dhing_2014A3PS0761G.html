But while we were not pumping iron trying to get into the University of Liftconsin I always enjoyed our little sessions where we tried to scheme a crapton of ways to earn a quick buck, from being a bounty hunter for the babas and the politicians to colonizing another third world country. The only regret is that we never got to execute our elaborate plan of making a few hundred bucks with help of our multiple "dronebots" if you remember it. We have discussed a whole range of subjects in the past couple of years like you said and I always liked your passionate take on them, like the time once you actually read the Bible. I have faith in you, you may not feel so right now but I know that a day will come when you'll disembowel Anshul and Bhateja in a single fight, and when it comes I'll be there to witness it with a bucket of popcorn. Keep in touch mate.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ABHINAV TRIPATHI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>When you're a short skinny guy in college, it is always nice to have someone who is equally skinny so that the jokes people make on it get distributed... thanks for being that person.

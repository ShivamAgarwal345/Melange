I remember the very first time we met, when you were walking back after a shower, and we spoke just in front of our room. To say that you are multi-talented and versatile would be a gross understatement and undermining of what you truly are. I have immense respect and admiration for your self-belief, your determination and your confidence. Literally, every course you pick up, you study it the way you fundamentally believe is to be studied, and you prove yourself by acing them all! Your epic stories are already well accounted for in this testimonial page. On a non-academic front, your skills in every sport, especially football, your energy and enthusiasm, manifested in the first year dances for the hostel truly round you as a complete all rounder, by its truest definition. You absolutely aced the MS process, and I'm sure you'll absolutely smash it at Stanford.

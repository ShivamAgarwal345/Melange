(Can't think of more Coldplay titles to add :P so I'll stop).  You are certainly one of the most cheerful and lively people I have met and always stay that way.

I remember the days when we used to be just project partners and then we started talking and eventually I realized how beautiful you are. I know, people might think of you as someone who likes to speak a lot and click pretty pictures but I trust me you are much more than that.  So let me tell them who Ishita really is -   She is a person who will listen to you patiently, no matter what time it is or how many times it is. She is a girl who will go out and eat with you if you feel like it, even though is isn't hungry. She will straight away tell you that your cloths doesn't make any sense to her, not because she is picky about cloths but because she wants you to look good in public. She will travel to your home just to meet you on weekends for a couple of hours and will say " I miss you " over and over again. She is that girl you will silently send you all the heart warming posts from " The Artidote" on instagram.  She is a girl who will make you believe that there is more to life and love is always round the corner. In the end, she is a girl you shouldn't in any case stop loving because in the end she just wants to see you smile a bit wider and laugh more often.  So to all the people out there trying to read her, I will just say: " She is our friend and she is crazy!" :* </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ABHIMANYU SINGH SHEKHAWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>I am a big fan of your fashion sense.

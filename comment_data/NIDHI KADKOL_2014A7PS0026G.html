You're an incredibly sweet, funny, and caring person, and I am glad I met you. I will always miss talking to you about movies and books and Harry Potter and Bangalore and everything else, and taking long walks with you after tests, and watching random movies with you. Never change. All the best for your future!

I will always remember our 1st year LDC walks with Aabir and Co. - when you were still in your spit conscious, 'pavam' avatar. You are hands down, one of the smartest people I know. "Aaaaaaaas-if" you will meet anyone who is more gossip hungry than you! Keep in touch. Also, keep acing everything and whining about it. All the best!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ROHAN A GAJENDRAGADKAR<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Haha, those were the times.

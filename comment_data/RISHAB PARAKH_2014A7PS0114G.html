Thank you for putting up with all my crazy rants . College night life was lit because of your uno plans and basketball court would always miss you .Always be my partner in everything that should not be done and also my one and only wingman and also for the book hunts through bangalore (which would have pretty much sucked if not for you ).

I will never forget the several nights we spent lying on the basketball court under the stars discussing random shit extremely seriously. Nor will I forget how we would meet almost everyday in CCD, sometimes even without sync. And let's not talk about all the projects we did (or the projects that we actually didn't) together :p I am lucky to have known and been friends with someo...blah blah blah. Gaand mara.

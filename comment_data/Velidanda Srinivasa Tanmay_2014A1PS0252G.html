Thanks for being a bit of an on-campus mom, pushing me into doing useful things that I'd been putting off or dismissive about; you know full well how much that's helped, professionally or otherwise. There's many things that I admire about you but would never dare to admit. Which means I won't say them here either, so good luck figuring them out. I doubt distance will be much of a separator here, since we've managed just fine with weeks non-contact on campus too :P And you have vested interests in this relationship, seeing as how you need to learn Marathi to cement vaini's family's approval. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NISSIM GORE-DATAR<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Danda, there's something which I admire the most about you, the clarity which you have for your life goals...Bakchod at its max and yet fully committed to your goals....Rarely have I come across a person as dedicated as you...Cheers to all the moments that we shared...

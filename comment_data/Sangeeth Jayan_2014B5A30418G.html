I have always felt of you as a super fortunate kid. You will be part of a lot of sweet memories of my BITS life - be it my first flight where you tried to scare the shit out of me of telling about flight accidents(I know you enjoyed that) , be it running together to get the flight after realising I lost my racket with the security(I still remember your face when I said my racket is missing :p), the guitar lessons, teasing you with girls, the gay jokes etc(I still don't know the magic with which you attract so many men). Btw, I like your mom a lot. Only advice to you: try to be a bit more kind. Try to understand from other's perspective. PS: Being the grammar nazi you are, I'm pretty sure, you will be counting the mistakes in my writing here too. PPS: Keep calm and enjoy Holi. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>I used to wonder if the ah2 common room was actually your room.

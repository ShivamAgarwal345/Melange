<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>"It's a bug" That PT1 T2 is definitely the last thing I'll forget about college. Really really amazed by your attitude and tolerance levels. Sorry for the time I hit you. But I guess that's a testimonial to my subconscious awareness of your tolerance levels. :P(I tried to spin it) Our best in hostel memories have been in your room thanks to your universal reception and free WiFi.  Trust me I've learnt a great deal from you although I suck at implementing it.  Thank you. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Shreyas Rajesh<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>subu.. aka shashi.. your room will always be our hideout .. your are an amazing fella...there are lots of things to say but i will say only one thing.. batman.. all the best for the future.. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...DEVESH RAWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Bad Rapport group says "Mooooo and shank that V-booty"</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...B RACHITH AIYAPPA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Your presence is a warm feeling that is hard to put into words - it's something in the skeptical looks, hysterical laughter, 'ohmagaaawd,' and - ugh, just meet already in Bangalore :P</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Veena Vijai<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

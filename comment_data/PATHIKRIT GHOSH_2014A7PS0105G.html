<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Pati bro. You were the first person I spoke to in this college and although we didn't speak a lot in the beginning, atleast we started hanging out in the end. It was so fun to see some of the crazy shit you did. The crazy dance you did during the Manipal trip comes to mind. You were a lot of help during exam time because of the sheer amount of knowledge you had and I'm sure you're going to go on and do something great in life. Take care.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Kartik Kenny<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>People really change over three years. From being on one side of the door asking the music to be turned down to being on the other side dancing to it, I guess somewhere between shut up and shata, college went by. From FIFA squads, prob stats, badminton, squash tips and Manipal, I have plenty of good memories with you. The most dedicated student, yet humble enough to handle success. I just feel sometimes you underestimate yourself so I want to let you know that it is no fluke that you managed to crack Directi and get a thesis abroad so have faith in yourself, because you are much better than you give yourself credit for.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...CHINTAN BETRABET<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Yo pathi...

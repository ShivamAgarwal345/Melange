Our friendship has been such a roller coaster in our college life that it is hard to look back and see how far we have come. From one-sided crush to best buddies who share literally everything under the sun. I have never seen a self-motivated, consistent, fitness-freak person in my life who apparently, also happens to be a foodie and party person. I still have no idea how you make it work but I really respect you for your discipline and focus. These past few months have been a lot easier because of you and your fun-loving nature, Thanks for putting up with my Zodiac sign obsessions, my short-temper and my mood swings. You have been there for me in my toughest times when I needed a friend the most and my happy times as well to remind me that I deserve it. No matter what came through, you have been a constant support and my "sixth sense" tells me, this will continue. And as per our favourite, Phoebe says "Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but THIS is for life". I hope you achieve the best in your life because you deserve it and because I know you are working hard for it. Let's ace life together. And stay in touch OR .........(need I say more :P) Stay Amazing. Love you #freakoutalert :P</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ADITI MAHESHWARI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Ayye marines lines ka ameer gujju xP You're the good kinda crazy and passionate.

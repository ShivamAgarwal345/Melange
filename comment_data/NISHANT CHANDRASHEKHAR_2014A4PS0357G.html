We say such random shit and then laugh about it all the time(when one person says 'paityam' and the other person says 'Ni aa?'). It's amazing that I could meet someone so similar to me in terms of music taste and other stuff(Devgeet also). Czeck for life man. We have done so much shit together...the walks, the trips, the songs we have recorded, the late night bakchodi, TT, trips to the NC, gym, CID in Dev's room, Civ Nites, troubling Omkar. I really wish it didn't have to end. We have climbed so much shit togehter, it's ridiculous. Let's try to keep meeting and doing such 'activities' in the future too. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Kartik Kenny<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Truly one of the nicest people I've met.

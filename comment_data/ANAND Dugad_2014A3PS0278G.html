He has a very solid character wherein he tries to uphold his virtues and ideals over most other things. Even though this does irk people at various instances, it is not easy to brave other people in a battle of ideals and thoughts - and he does just that. He is one of those people who would mingle with almost everybody and in most cases will leave a mark upon them. He has probably been my ideal partner, and I'm sure he believes the same about me - right from Physics Lab to PS-1 at CEERI Pilani to a Lab in a ME course, we have complemented each other just fine. I wish him all the best for his future, which I am very sure he is going to do well in.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Sanjeev Sripadraj Murthy<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Anand!Supersaiyan!

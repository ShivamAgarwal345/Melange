Add to that the bio classes, where you were my sole sympathizer in the face of Urvashi and Co., and your presence was certainly an unforgettable part of college life.

You, my friend with all your little germophobic quirks are one of the most kindhearted people I know. All those unnecessary "Sorries" and "It's Okays", watching all those Impractical Jokers episodes and all the fun we had in the EPS video activity was something I'll cherish forever. I still hope that the next time you work on some neuroscience project, you'll try to inculcate some experiments on monkeys. Pro Rubix cube solver! _/\_ Please don't ever change. Stay the same germophobic and slightly obsessive compulsive throughout your life! You'll do great things in life, I'm sure of that.

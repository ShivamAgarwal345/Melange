This makes you a wonderful friend one can have and I'm glad I have you as my friend. You were there on my days of depression and you helped me recover it too. I still remember it was you and Honey who came and talk to me, in that particular crucial moment of my life. Thank you dear, thanks for those comforting words, thanks for being an awesome friend.

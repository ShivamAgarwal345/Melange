<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Dear Aashima, I do not know how to thank you for being such a great friend to me throughout my college life. I might not have told you this but I really admire your genuineness and ability to bond with people no matter what. You always know how to make others laugh and even laugh at yourself when you get things wrong: for example No, gorillas do NOT exist on Mars and Annaleise Keating does not have cancer just because she wears a wig! I know how much you value friendship and I always know whom to go to when I have troubles pestering me, or I want to complain about life. One of the most memorable moments with you was when I left campus for the last time in 3-2, and I gifted you a bunch of ___. Your reaction was something I still remember to this day. I wish you a lifetime of happiness and love.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ROHAN Dutta<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Aashimaa,my Punjabi girl, the only solace in the boring Physics life. Do you remember our first Physics VGH dinner? You were running around talking to people. I had a lot of fun studying Physics with you. And even more fun attending together a particular class just to see that particular person (that damn smile!) (well I think he laid the foundation of our friendship unknowingly :P) And the endless crushes we both had :/  I love how you keep your friendships so nicely. You are that perfect friend to anybody - fun loving, sincere, caring and 100 percent original. There was literally a time when I asked you to share your wisdom in keeping so good friendships. It was easy connecting with you and you are one person I look forward to being friends forever. And girl, your workouts did find its fruits - your hotness increased exponentially. Stay awesome :) Stay connected :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>One of the most enthusiastic girl I've ever met.Keep your will to learn new things.

Remain in touch and continue being just as much fun as you are. :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...KADAMB GUPTA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Aashima!

Kartik :* It was amazing to see you everyday jumping around ( and touching the ceiling ) in your exotic shorts. I always saw you with sitting on your chair and watching some anime or just playing Civ. You sometimes used to sleep with your door open and you looked so innocent. I miss our twisted and deep conversations about Dimensional Gods XD. You have an amazingly dark humor and I am a big fan. Although you take a century to finish your meals but I would love to eat out with you. Actually I think you are a pretty mature and balanced person who is going to do great in life. Also keep suggesting me movies, I will love to watch some with you here in Bangalore. Love you bro :* </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ABHIMANYU SINGH SHEKHAWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Hey weird wingmate, it was nice to see you unique bakchodis and your memes were a delight.

Although our routines didn't really match for the most part. You were one of the first people I got to know on campus and being an introvert that really means a lot. From being the first one to wish me on my 'not birthday' to all those night long treasure hunts we never completed and the long and super forced birthday speeches which I still have the videos of by the way weve had some great memories I'll forever cherish.

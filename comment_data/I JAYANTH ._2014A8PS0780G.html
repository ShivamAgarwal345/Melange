I think we could have skipped buying the 5kg dumbells vaise xD Lifting me up on Quark nights and all, too much fun. I'll always remember our super long late night convos (I would always leave in 5 min max) something and all we spoke xD Made a CH3 essentials list as well. The CH3 flavour wouldn't be alright without you. And our CH3 flavour was such it would even make Erina Nakiri clothes rip off as in Shokugeki no Soma xD kaafi sweet you are :* And cutie pie MAXIMUS</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...YASH MEHTA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Jayanth, why are you so weird. I wish you had written all your bullshit theories somewhere.Only you can make your own religion and have a dance step for it. The Ch3 essential list will always be incomplete without you. I'll always remember our late night conversations in Ch3 and the looks people gave on finding us on the same spot on the stairs. The bogmalo trip with you in the bus was amazing. You are a true Diva. Itne nakhre omg. Bahot kuch hai likhne ko. I'll stop coz you won't appreciate it much I know. All the best for whatever you want to do. Working in the same company as you would be really exciting( or not. Time will tell)Lets see how many of the coin predictions turn out to be true.Call me if you marry a gold digger.Till then keep making theories.Stop throwing away roses which girls give to you.Keep making weird noises. And stay AWESOME.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MANU SARASWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Creep mofo.

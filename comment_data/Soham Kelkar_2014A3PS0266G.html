The guy who tries to show "faltu ka swag" and manages to succeed on some occasions as well, has taught me a lot of things in these 4 years, which became all the more memorable because of him. A fine gamer, an awesome pianist and even better human being, I'm sure Hell Rider will do well in his future.

But let me try. It all started in the bank if I am not mistaken. When you became an honorary member of our corridor. Our friendship started because our lanuguage was the same (though we all know how fluent you are in it), but today we don't need the reliance on any language to know what is going on in each others mind. I am 100% sure not a single couple on campus can beat us in Rohan's game. I openly challenge everyone. I think my friendship with you defines the word 'friendship'. We've seen each other at our happiest moments, we've seen each other at our worst and one thing that I would like to tell you is that don't have a single regret about anything in the past 4 years. It has all been worth it and it is these experiences that are going to drive you towards that direction. Don't change the way you are even though you are too good for the world, even though people might use you, but one day it is this nature that is going to get you everything you ever desired. And in our next Journey though I won't be physically with you, you will always be in my heart. Also don't forget about DMK. We have loads to achieve.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ANAND Dugad<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>We have reached point where our start is too much years ago and our end is when death will doth us part.

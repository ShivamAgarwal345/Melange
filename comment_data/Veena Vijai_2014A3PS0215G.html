I am so glad that I could finally meet your parents and obviously Vandana ;). I hope that you soon become good at driving and navigating. Jokes apart, I know that you know but I still want you to know that I will always always always be there whenever you need me and even if you don't. I know that I would be receiving a Rakhi every year however far we are. Thank You for being there in my journey of BITS. It would have been seriously bland and boring without you.

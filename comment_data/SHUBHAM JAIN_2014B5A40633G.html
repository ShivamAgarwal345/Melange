See we have decided to die at 65 .. don't ditch me, Okay!

Singing old songs and taking ayushi's case was always fun. By the way bangs karwane hai , money transfer kar na :P. Bhula na to maar khayega.

Without you my college life is incomplete, for obvious reasons. From meeting in the Nirmaan inductions for the first time, becoming such good friends and whatever followed :P Thank you for being a better friend than most people are able to be in a lifetime. Without your help, support and constant daant I don't know if I would've been able to be half of what I am today. Thank you for teaching me to be besharam and that life is too short to give fucks to people and things. Always stay the same, loud, Bhopali who boasts about how well he cooks. You will be terribly missed. I really hope you always stay a part of my life! I hope you get everything you want in life and I hope we get to dance and look stupid once more in life! Loads of love! :*</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SUMEGHA SINGHANIA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Let's go trekking together pleasee .

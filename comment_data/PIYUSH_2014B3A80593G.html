Maybe it is because you are a great person and above that a lovely friend. Bangalore is very nice but I seriously miss all the late night talks we had about your " to be girlfriends " and numerous other stuff. You never gave up be it on anything and trust me you are the fool who will one day do the impossible. I loved the idea of " Je'kins" and maybe that was the time we came very much closer. I can't forget how many times I took you for just eating Pasta with me. You were my endless supply of oreganos and thanks for trusting me with all your stuff. All the best for everything in your life, may you grow huge muscles and get all the amazing ladies out there.   -- Someone who loved your annoying music playlist and the person playing it. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ABHIMANYU SINGH SHEKHAWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Pahwa bhai, first of all I want to say one thing to you..... tu chutiya hai. And this is coming from an experienced guy jisne tujhe 4 saal jhela hai, pehle eco mai phir eni mai. Jitni fights meri tere saath hui hai utni baaki sab se mila ke nhi hoti, but last mai koi bhi reason ho lekin suleh ho hi jati hai (pta nhi kyun). At the end no matter what we say to each other, ek baat to hai ki tu banda itna bura bhi nhi hai, so keep in touch and all the best for future !! :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MADHUR GARG<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

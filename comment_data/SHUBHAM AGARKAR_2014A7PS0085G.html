Tere saath kitne logon ko judge kiya LCS classes mein, kitne projects aur assignments kiye, TA bhi bana, gaaliyan bhi khaayin, marathon bhi bhaage. Pro aur aalsi donon hi tu hamesha se hi hai. I think the only reason you finish marathons fast is so that you can go back and sleep. Having slept back alone on a class that we were supposed to TAKE wouldn't have been as much fun. I will remember you for the honesty with which you approached things in life. Good luck to this free agent who I am sure is going to do several awesome things in the future!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ADARSH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Yo Blondie, sorry for irritating you a lot in these 4 years.

From very beginning to very end we have been together, even though I have not been a good friend to you, you are always there to back me up, be it quark , be it projects, or be it PS1, i have never thanked you and i may not even thank you in future, but this day take my heartiest gratitude. :) P.S. thoda kam khaya kar -_- </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MAYANK Anchlia<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Cheers to our 14 years of friendship since school life.

I have known u through all these nick names. 10 yrs... In these years, one of the most appreciable things I found about u was ur genuinity towards everything- Friendship, Knowledge and even your Mistakes. I may not say that often, but u r a friend on whom we all regularly depend but don't thank enough. So today, u can take these words in writing. PS:Thanks for introducing me to "Friends" especially at a time when I was content with watching "Son Of Abhish". LOL... Take care and stay in touch. Move back to Bangalore ASAP. U can thank me later for introducing you to Minkya. 12 baje NC??? -Mota</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...KESHAV SINGHAL<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Hey M-anal, You are one of the few people I have met who is very dedicated (and who eats a lot :p).

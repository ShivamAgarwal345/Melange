Moving on to the semesters on campus full nights we have end up staying doing bakchodi and watching HIMYM together with Pizza and Pepsi. All the times I have taught you ADVD and Mue and all the times you have taught me IIC and Disco. Our Group studies is something which I'll definitely miss because you'll hardly ever study after college :P The guy with the most logical mind and best reviewer of things be it movies or life advice or alcohol. You are the main reason for decreasing coolness in me. Cheers to the times when we both were afraid of placements and never were able to decide what to order from swiggy under an hour. Cheers to the times you have taught me how to cook maggi and taught me how to save money and do kanjoosi :P I do look up to you for many things in life (Actually not so many :P).

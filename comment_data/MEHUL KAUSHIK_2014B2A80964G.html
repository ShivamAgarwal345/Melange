I can't match Atish's testimonial. It's way too true :P  Okay so here I start.  I haven't even joined campus yet, and I read a Facebook post by this random guy, who aspires to work hard to get a vertical to Computer Science. I thought, well I have competition now.   Fast forward 1st week on campus, and my first conversation with this person. "Bhai Chemical to mil jaayegi na?" HAHAHA, seriously the first funny joke I got from this guy. I can't state all his jokes and kaarname, but he is damn too funny.  Then came the year when we in the same class to learn Chemistry, which both of us had ZERO interest in. The first semester, cracking all those jokes in classes, and me not able to control my laughter, some of these moments I will never forget.  To being this cheerful, naughty guy to being my food partner, random doubt solver, and meme tagger, it was a great time on campus having a friend like you.  I pardon you for all those puns you throw on me :P You are a much bigger friend to me than all that.   Apart from all this, yeh EPS and Bio Lab top kar chuka hai, Javascript, ReactJS are on tip of his fingers, knows to develop websites (has created a few for professionals), and has even applied for internships in google and Facebook, with confidence !  I seriously hope you will continue being the way you are, and not change.

But as a midget pornstar once said "I have to disagree. Death is so normie, yet dead baby memes are full of dankness". We've had Purge nights and we've had random YouTube nights, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot Pulp Fiction of a time!

From sharing 1 set of semester books to sharing a Khamba, from being roomies on campus to the endless night stays back in Delhi, from you being a tea-toddler to you forcing me to Bog for two beers, from you teaching me a course from the scratch to me telling you what to mug up half an hour before the exam, We've seen it all, done it all. You're one of the very few persons I'm gonna miss seeing everyday. Nevertheless you will eventually become that well-read, know-it-all uncle to my kids. Like I always say "you would be the most ideal son for my dad" haha.

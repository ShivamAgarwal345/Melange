<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Seldom I have come across someone with whom my interest match so much. Sports, politics, and most importantly life. The walks and talks we had, were something that shaped my ideology and I shall always look forward to a lot more of these. Such conversations can neither go out of fashion, not get boring. Thank you for lending me a ear whenever I needed to put things out of my head, there aren't many people better than you at this. And, that's extremely rare in the world because everyone is just concerned with their own life and well being.  Bangalore was made a lot more fun because of you there.  In life, I hope I get more people life who understand life so deeply and keep a open mind about things to such a great extent.  I won't say 'stay in touch', because we have to. And, I have no doubt that we will. :) All the best for life, dude. I know you'll ace it, given how calculated and dedicated you are.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SIDDHANT RATHORE .<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>One of the most down to earth and humble guys i have ever come across.

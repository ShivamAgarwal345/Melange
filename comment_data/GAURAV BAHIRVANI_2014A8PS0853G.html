It has given be priceless gems in the form of friends and you my friend, were the most invaluable of them all. I really got to learn a lot of things from you - especially your determination. The one you have worked on your body is just awe-inspiring. Ab bas bhi karo, baakiyon ko complex aa raha hai. I remember how tense you were about placements but maine tereko pehle ki kaha tha ki TI toh mil hi jaega tujhe. I don't know how many people have told you this, but I have told you many times and reiterate that there are very very few people in our campus who know Analog even half as good as you. It saddens me that we couldn't bond earlier but those memories in the final two years more than compensate for them.

Though I was 100% sure that you were going to get placed in TI but that one moment made me ecstatic. I know that your decision of staying on campus in first sem worked out perfectly but mera dil aaj bhi chahta hain ki tum second sem rukte. I seriously miss you yaar. I have never met someone as plain hearted as you. You are one of the people who will go to the end of the world for his friends, without thinking twice. Your dedication to become fit by excessive gyming and a crazy diet has humbled me. Iska 1% bhi dedication ho to bhi mere liye kaafi badi baat hain. Another amazing quality I find in you is that you are very open and frank with your friends (sometimes a bit too open and this might be harmful for you). Coming to CEERI and meeting you was one of the best things in BITS. I really do wish you the best in life. Naukri to badiya mil gayi hain, jald se jald chokri bhi pata lo.

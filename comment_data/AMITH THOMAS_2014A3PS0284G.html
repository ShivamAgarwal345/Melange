<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>If there is one thing I regret about what I did in my first year, it is that I chose to keep a distance from you. That was such a mistake. But then I'm glad that it all turned out well at the end. It was for your kind heart that you came over to apologize for not even a mistake you did when I got hit accidentally by the football you threw. You are a really strong person emotionally and I have seen you dealing with shit in the most graceful way as possible. But still in moments of breaking down, I hope you remember me and I promise I will be there for you. I'm counting on this friendship forever. Stay awesome! </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Had great and an amazing time working with you in Workshop activities.

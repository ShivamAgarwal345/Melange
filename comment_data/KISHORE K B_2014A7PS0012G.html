It was so much fun talking to you in the mess, NC about anime and so much random stuff. All those nights we used to randomly turn up at your room for "K meet" and you used to wake up and entertain us even though you were sleeping, the nights we would stay awake playing TT, going for walks, going to Bog, the trips we too... I don't think I'll ever forget all those times. I know you're a really smart person and if you apply yourself, which you will, I see you going places in life. Keep in touch. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Kartik Kenny<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Kishore da, you're genuinely one of the nicest people I know.

Effortlessly you would take my mind off of things with anything from anime sessions to the latest tamil flicks to WWE history lessons! The number of tamil films I've seen on campus are all thanks to you. Every single one! The biggest heart for friends resides in your well toned body! If there is one person I would associate all of my unhindered tamil self on campus with, it would be you! Cheers to you, Thalaivar!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SHUBH VACHHER<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

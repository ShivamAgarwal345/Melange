Maza aa gaya yaar. Got to know you by the 2nd year in chemical class, the guy who never missed a class and had the most comprehensive notes. We really hit it off from Azeotropy back in 2-2 and there was no looking back since. I love your aggressive, competitive streak, I felt it pushed me more, made me more motivated and determined to do better. We had similar aims back in third year, and I think we were both very successful in achieving our targets. Saath mein revise karna, past papers solve karna, in retrospect, was fun too :P But on a non-academic front, my god, youâ??re a huge cricket fan, khaas kar Indian team ki :P (even on home conditions, jab hum bully karte hain dusron ko). Youâ??re an amazing sports lover, raat ko masti karte hue bhi kaafi dekha hu :P Youâ??ve been an amazing friend, companion and supporter of me. You know very well that I wish you all the very best for every endeavour you take up, mereko toh pakka malum hai ki you will shine! Take care and lets keep in touch :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Velidanda Srinivasa Tanmay<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Kapil bro, thanks for all the help in academics.

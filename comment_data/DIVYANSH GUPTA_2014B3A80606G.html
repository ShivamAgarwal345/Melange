After 4 yrs of vetoing, planning and overdoing our budgets, the one thing I can say for sure is that u have a big heart. Always stay the same and keep cherishing delicious food. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...KESHAV SINGHAL<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Oh boy, where to start? Let's start at the beginning. My first day in college. There is a knock on my door. It was 2 guys. A shorter, thin one and a taller, fat one. The second guy says, "Hi. Are you also first year?" We start talking in our shitty, small town English, until the first guy says, "Hum sabko Hindi aati hai na?" And we start laughing. The first guy I talked to in this college was you. Who knows where we would've ended up if there wasn't a knock on my door that evening. We had A LOT of debates, arguments, insult matches and fights in these 4 years, but we've had countless amazing moments too. And I loved each one of them. And I'm proud to say that I coined the name "Sir ji" and I was the first guy who gave you your first chappal treatment on your birthday.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NAMAN AGARWAL<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>"Movie X is going to earn Y millions, I've read in an article".

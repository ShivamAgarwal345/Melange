Your sarcasm and no-bullshit attitude is something that will always amaze and inspire me. I know for a fact that you'll rise high in life, given how much clarity and poise you have.Watching you play TT in this Spree, made me realise the patience you exhibit before taking any action. or a shot. Being around you is fun, not just because it's fun but also because you don't hesitate in telling what is wrong. That is something everyone should have.  Probably the most open minded and accepting person I know. Thanks for the memories. Stay in touch. Rock it.

Aaj kal aise ladke kaha milte hain. From then it has been an amazing journey. To see you ace the tennis matches with that aggressive small talks between the shots was so much fun. I still remember that I always had this image of you of a boy who is so open minded and it was so true. Be this accepting always. It feels so good to see you acing your life. It gives me a lot of motivation to do something good in academics. :P Come back soon to India. And keep telling me 'important' things on text messages. Please learn to crack lames jokes from me.

Bangalore? Because that is where our closeness increased exponentially. Or DD? Which was the first time we were involved in politics. Or that one night when 5 of us just sat in 120 talking about life? Or my favorite, the mathematical analysis of probability of rape as a function of various variables? I think we have talked about so many things in such great detail that finding the exact combination of words (that too after finding out about this stupid word limit) is going to be difficult. You have played a major part in transforming me from a rigid, naive boy to a person who has finally started to accept different view-points even if he doesn't agree with them. Apart from that I have really enjoyed having a friend with the same sense of humour which both of us will have to take of at least for the next 5 years.

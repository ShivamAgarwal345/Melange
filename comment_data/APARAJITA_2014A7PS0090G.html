You have tolerated me, my lame jokes and my endless supply of insults for the last 4 years and I hope that god gives you the strength to tolerate them for the rest of your life. We grew pretty close over the last year and I hope we stay the same. I'll always remember the numerous hours we spent talking and walking around the campus occasionally listening to the other person rant. Conversations with you have always been great making us loose track of time which resulted in you crying for sleep while I kept forcing you to stay for breakfast. XD People here are calling you sassy and sarcastic but I'll keep calling you cute because that's what you actually are, a cute cat! Oh and one last thing, tere shaadi me "Jaa Chudel" pakka gayenge. :P</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...RISHAB PARAKH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>We came to know each other only in the last year, but I have really enjoyed your company.

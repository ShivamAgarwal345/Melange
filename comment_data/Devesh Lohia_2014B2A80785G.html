You are the reason that I never got E grades in Chemistry. You were always there to score even less. Labs wouldn't have been that great without your constant shenanigans. We really bonded when the two of us were trapped in hell for 2 months(Read: Angul). This past semester I've had the privilege to have you as a "Part-Time-Roommate" and even if it seems that sometimes you annoy me, believe you me that I'd rather have you there than not. One day soon, tera koi business idea chal jaega and tu bhot phod dega. Shaadi me jaroor invite kriyo(Don't worry I'll not warn her) and please do serve non-veg food too. Just don't forget this "Part-Time-Roommate" when you're at the epitome of success. Wishing you all the best for your future. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MEHUL KAUSHIK<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Gangu bhai poker prodigy. bhai you are a really nice guy.

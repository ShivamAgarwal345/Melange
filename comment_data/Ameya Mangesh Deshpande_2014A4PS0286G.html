Not to forget that your room was always the amphitheater, the ideal place to watch all those movies. It was always fun playing by your side in AoE as it helped having a stable guy at the other end.It took all of 7 semesters for you to open up about Tirupati ;). Yes we will not stop on this. It has been real fun spending these 4 years with you and I have learnt many a thing from you but most importantly how to take everything jokingly and calmly without getting agitated. Here is to our career in Carnatic music and all those Purandaradasa bhajans xD. To the guy who believes in maximum outcome with the most minimum of effort - all the best for your future.

But this difference in taste has never hindered any quality and sensible discussion that we had. You are undoubtedly the calmest member of our group. The question is, is it because you don't get irked easily or is it because it takes too much effort to show your anger and do something about it so you choose to remain calm. I believe the latter is true. I know you are a bit worried about the admits currently but a few years in the future you will realise that there was nothing to be worried about. I am sure that whatever you plan on doing after masters you are going to be successful if you remember a couple of things. Sometimes you need to take some effort. I am glad that you have started doing it with Tirupathi. Secondly always carry your ID with you so that you don't waste your and others valuable time :p. US madhe bhetuch nakki. Paintball is the new common liking we have after AOE and this we will pursue in the states.

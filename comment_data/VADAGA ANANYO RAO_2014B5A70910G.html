When you decide to do a thing you make sure you do it full justice , be if anything. Our morning jogs to bog and hollant were truly amazing. I still remember breakfast in zari, after that rewarding jog and trek to hollante. Tambdi surla and dudhsagar would have been dry without your enthusiasm. And not to mention solving all those physics assignments together. Hyperloop mai saath mai kaam karne mai maza aya.

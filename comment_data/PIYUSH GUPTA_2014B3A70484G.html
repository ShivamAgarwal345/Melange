If there was one person who has given me a different perspective on life in college it has to be you. If there is one person who has changed his personality as a chameleon every semester, it is you. Seeing you get out of your comfort zone and experiment has really really motivated everyone around. Will miss the late night discussions, the life crisis calls during holidays and the computer science wali bandi ke problems :P Keep up the Gurgaon swag and play Punjabi songs forever ! All the best! I hope there is a time in life when i get to put this up on Quora.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...RIKKIN AMIT MAJANI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Maggguuuuu......itna mat padha kar life mai !! bass hogya ab aur soojh nhi rha !bye.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MADLE SNEHA MALASIDDHA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Sirji! Please keep on spreading the message of getting out of your comfort zone wherever you go and show yourself as the prime example of the profound impact that it can have on one's life. Always the capricious guy around and an avid consumer of non fiction books and a true economist at heart and a proper vala TDC. Kaafi GRE ho gaya abhi :P It am pretty sure I would not have enjoyed the company of the 1st year vala Piyush. Cheers to the drastic change that gave you this avatar.  P.S: Bira bhi acchi hai yaar. Dont be so biased towards Kingfisher.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...KATHAN KASHIPAREKH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Only TDC who does not come across as a Delhite.Had great fun talking with you especially when you would get serious about stuff and start giving great advice on different stuff.And your world famous "get out of your comfort zone" has touched my life as well.

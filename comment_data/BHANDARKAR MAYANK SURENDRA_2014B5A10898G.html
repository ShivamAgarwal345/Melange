Looks away for a second* Me: Kya kar raha hai, dekh na. *rewinds* This happened more times than I can count. I know you are pissed off about everyone talking about gym so I won't talk about that. But you were probably the one person who agreed with me on most things. First came FMaC and the hours of bitching. Then I showed you feminist cringe and we had another common thing to bitch about. Then the anime phase. We've gone through a lot together. And learned a lot together. The one bad thing is how blunt you are and it is also the thing most to be appreciated. PS: Never leave Mrunal.

Prudhvi has always been the silent observant. The Real Thalaiva neighbour has always helped me quench my thirst and has rather not so fortunate birthday clashing with Ashkandh Prasad. Prudhvi is always soft spoken (Until He starts drinking Old Monk neat) and romances in his imaginative world with SG :P He likes F1 so much that he wont let anyone change the channel and will always work at the same slowwww space no matter if there is any urgency or not. I really miss your company from PS2. Hoping you'll shift to Bangalore soon and we could become roommates once again :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NANDAN THAKUR<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

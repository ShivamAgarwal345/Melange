But the best part is how you motivate people around you, waking me up for every class without fail even though you know I am not going to is quite something. So thanks for taking care of this laid-back anime freak aka me. I am not going to say stay in touch, coz in all possible universes you will end up with me (just hope that in at least one of those parallel universes, we dont end up in tara manjunath).

One memorable incident that comes to my mind is from first or second year. You walked to Majorda and nearby beaches and came to my room and I was sitting there with my failure of gathering people for an outing. I rally admired your spirit. I loved how you didn't care about subjects you didn't like but totally rocked the ones you had interest in. It was a joyride watching you and Mayank fighting over silly reasons and then patching up :P I remember in first year, you were calculating your expected cgpa in my room and wondering whether CS milega ya nahn. Ek wo din tha and ek aaj ka din hai.CS God. It was fun teasing you with multiple girls :P Keep this dedication going. I am sure you will achieve great success in life. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MANU SARASWAT<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Mera campus par pehla dost :-P Teri party ab bhi due hai .Keep rocking and keep in touch</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...AVINASH LADDHA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>love u bro...keep in touch :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...AVIRAL CHAUHAN<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Howdy neighbour.

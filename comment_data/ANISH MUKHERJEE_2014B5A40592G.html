The way you remain calm and cool at any situation, amazing! One day you will be seating in your own office, drinking espresso while reading a novel and playing Pink Floyd songs in background.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Akshay Lavhale<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Yo Bro! Have always appreciate your perspective and views on life issues. One of the few members of the group who had such a logical and passionate approach to life. One day, I am sure, I will be sitting at my desk ,drinking cappuccino, and reading newspaper and find that ur company has made it to Fortune 500 or 100!!! Always stay the same and keep following your passion. Life will sort itself out. All the best and pls stay in touch. -Keshav (u r one of the few who calls me that)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...KESHAV SINGHAL<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Bhai, Most chilled out and down to earth person ever seen....Has knowledge on almost every subject.......Stay the same and milenge future mein kabhi... :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...HARSH VARDHAN SINGH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Rationalist and chill dude.

One day, I heard that seniors were rounding up firsties of our floor. I quickly switched off my lights (you know it to be a rare occurrence) and pretended to be asleep when there was a knock on my door and a guy shouted "Oye! bahar nikal b*******". It was the guy who lived in 204, who I thought was a senior. Although, I didn't open the door, I got to know it was just a stupid a****** firstie pranking me quite a while later. Turns out that firstie wasn't stupid and certainly wasn't an a******. I'm accepting it 4 years later. Congratulations, you successfully pranked me. Going to miss everything about you. The "JON SNOW ZINDA HAI" moment, that legendary middle finger, the parliament level debates, kejru ki beti, everything. Stay happy, stay high. Sada fukte raho. PS: One of these days, we HAVE to buy a bazooka and blow up the library.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...NAMAN AGARWAL<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>The most non-violent member of the group.

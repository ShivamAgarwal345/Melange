Tere bina ye college life adhuri rehti be. Thanks for always being there. Dual boot god keep rocking at 44 degrees. Those mongi trips, late night walks will definitely be missed. Library ka stud, Motorcycle Emptiness sunte rehna. Singu main uncle chips aur choco lava cake khana aur "Paaaaaani" peete rehna. All the best for your future man!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Devgeet K Patel<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Yo Chomder, had great time with you man.

But the shit we did in your room man... all those late night talks during exams where we did almost everything but study, our frisbee tradition, dumb charades, Civ nite, the three of us sleeping on your bed after that movie(it's time the world knows of our sins), were the best memories of my college life. All the walks, road trips, mongi trips...you're such a person to be around(except when you randomly get grumpy). Those songs we recorded were amazing(we should make a band). Best of luck for all your future endeavors.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Kartik Kenny<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Cheers to you, Chomuu! Your patience with your friends' pranks shouldn't be taken to equal your lack of fighting spirit, as I have seen coming out on countless occasions! One of the people who I can actually rely on if I get into a difficult situation. I can speak volumes about your good heart and our many many commonalities!! The timing of this testimonial is testimonial to them :) Saala Omdar, sorry about those bananas :* If you don't keep in touch, dangal hoga.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SHUBH VACHHER<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

You are the reason for existence of such a great bond. Innocent, independent, strong toh tu he hi, just stay the same and remember we are always here for you. All the memories we made, all the innocent 'haan ji', moody 'aachcha' and trade mark emoticons will always have a very special place in my life. Stay the same, stay innocent, stay happy..

Thanks for bearing with me. Thanks for handling my random mood swings. Thanks for NOT DISOWNING ME Thanks for all the support you have given me.  I admire how bubbly, innocent, caring and independent you are. I know how hard it is to tolerate me :P  All the memories we share, our outings, those NC talks, those "Mujhe ye nahi khana", "Yarrr" "Haan ji" " Hey babaji" is something I'll surely miss. Your timely advises have always proved beneficial. QnB ki jaan hai tu. You are the glue which holds us together. Chahe kitni bhi gali de, mai tujhe pareshan karna aur bakchodi katna nahi band karunga.  And to quote your favorite person " Jaise hai tu waisi hi rehna!"  All the best!

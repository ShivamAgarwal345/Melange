I wouldn't have been able to manage alone 6 months in IIT Madras. It was nice doing research along with you and I have learnt a lot from you. I enjoy all the outings, cooking we did in lab, watching movies together in lab etc. I hope you become a professor one day. All the Best and have a wonder life ahead!!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Igin Benny Ignatius<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Shabhu ji it was nice knowing you brother.

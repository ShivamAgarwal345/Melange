But I always knew that you are a God level (and i mean it) classical and contemporary dancer. As we started with our third year and moved ahead with our responsibilities i realised how strongly our minds connected and the way we resonated. I respect you and your principles about certain things and the way you have sorted out your future. I am gonna remember all our gossips and how we thought the same way about almost all the people, certain Surat memories, breakdowns, discussions and group fights with other club/dept people. I am glad that third year happened this way and i got to bond with you so strongly. You are an amazing person and I really hope you get the best in your future. MIT ka professor banke dont forget me. Always stay in touch.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...TANYA SHAHI .<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Bro I thought I was passionate about physics until I started working with you.

My jokes might be painful, but atleast people understand them. It's been 4 years and i still don't understand half of your highly intellectual jokes:p Your level of perfection, your dedication and your simplicity are only a few things out of the many amazing qualities you that make you not just a good but an highly functioning human being. Keep shinning like always. I wish you the best of my wishes. :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Mansi Swami<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Hey , I can keep going on and on and on but all that I can do in person. TBH there is nothing really that we don't know about each other. I can tell you one thing , whenever in future am down and out, you'll be the one I will call up and depress with my worries. Wish you best in life and don't let the love of physics hamper your so called "real love life" รฐ???รฐ???. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Wahiduddin Patel<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr></table>

I have loved all your songs in Music Night since Evanescence first year and still do (Always). I loved your EPS talks and still remember half of those. I loved Playing Badminton with you the other day. Wayy too much proness handling reverse duals and balancing chill life with work life. I still very clearly remember sitting outside C-Mess and getting to know you. Ever since then we have just randomly bumped into each other a lot of times and you have always replied saying "Hey Buddy". Your NonStop Energy has motivated me a lot throughout and You have been always an inspiration to me. Will always be.

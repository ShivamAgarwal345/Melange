I have been a first hand witness of the hard work that you put in for everything that you do in life - which many of us consider inhumane - aptly referring you to as the 'one true god'. With your insane memory skills, no one comes close to you when competing on dialogues from movies/tv-shows. You seem to have solutions to all problems in life and are the first person, who everyone including me refers to whenever we face difficulties. You crying your heart out after every test and then too topping it won't be missed because I am sure that you'll never stop doing that - and I'll never stop teasing you on the same:P</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Rohan Goel<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Debu the life support for all the ENI people in our group. Ye monkey, pinky and murgi itna bol diya hai ki mere liye kuch bacha hi nhi. But for those reading this other than you, I would like to give a disclaimer about him 1. If he says, he hasn't done some work or won't score good marks on some test, don't believe him, isne wo kam kar liya hai aur wo test ye phod ke aaya hai. 2. This guy has the capability to study/do work for weeks at a go with as little as no sleep, so if you are colleague, start your work months before him. 3. Ye dada ji wali image is too over-rated, nobody talked about the drinking capacity he has 4. If you think he is not hearing you in your gossip, chances are he is and if its a rumour he has already heard of it. 5. But the last of all and probably the most important, he is a good friend, which is his best quality  All the best for future brother !! :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MADHUR GARG<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Debu!

There are very few people who are as calm as you. And I have really tried to learn that from you. I would really miss the chance to watch Wimbledon together, cheering for Federer, like we did in CEERI. Abhi to vo jeet bhi raha hain. Yeh jindagi ret jaisi hain. Hum jitna is kas ke pakadne ki koshish karenge ye utne jaldi haath se nikal jaayegi. Humare saath bhi shayad yahi hua. Jitna jyaada mujhe lagne laga ki hum sab aur time ke liye ek saath hone chahiye, hum utne hi jaldi dur chale gaye. Koi nahi.

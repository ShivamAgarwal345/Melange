"Useless Issue" pe bhi hum kafi discuss kar chuke hai xD. Har chiz ke 2 meaning batate rehna. Ab shakal ka toh kuch kar nahi sakte, baatein toh achi kar hi leta hai tu. Zarurat hogi toh aur log room pe aa jayenge tere lekin mai room ke bahar chala jaunga. Sakht TA wala sapna juniors ko pass on karna.

TRW was a watershed moment in our friendship, largely because at least you knew who I am in person and not just name and there has been no going back since. It might actually be easier for the government to get Vijay Malya to pay back his loans than to get a treat out of you, the deal it took to get a birthday treat from you is still fresh in my memory. When it comes to taking a treat, you leave nothing to chance. I can imagine you sitting next to the banks of the Ganga, sipping a cup of hot Coco on a cold winter night ,stuffed after your Rasmalai eating Spree just because someone offered to treat you to sweets there. To all the wonderful stories woven around our hero Priyank for every lab and watching juniors shiver in fright at the mention of his name. We certainly left a legacy behind.

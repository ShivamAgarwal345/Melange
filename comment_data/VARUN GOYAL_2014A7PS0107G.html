From numerous ashkandh stories and theories to all night bakchod talks and poker games we did a lot of thing together.Thanks bro for the great time and hope our bakchodi goes on forever.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SHIVAM GUPTA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>The guy with the most perseverance.

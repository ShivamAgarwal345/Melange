You keep crying that I leave before you but that didn't stop me from doing so did it ? I can remember your happiness the one or two times you left before me. I'll always remember the tennis matches we watched in the common room (though mostly on rival sides) and your wise comments in between. (former) Captain sir, teach me tennis one day (though I have said that a million times and not done anything about it). You have your own not so obvious way of showing people you care but you are a wonderful person at heart. Sorry about the times the music we played in Kartik's room and bothered you! The most important thing you taught me in life is to not wake up a sleeping person unless asked to (Sorry that I never woke you when you asked in the morning because I wasn't up ever :p). Stay the creative allrounder that you are and stay in touch. One day I'll show off that I know you to my kids :).</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...CHINTAN BETRABET<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Rachitaaa.

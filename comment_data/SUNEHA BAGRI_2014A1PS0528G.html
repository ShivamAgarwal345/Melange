Be it Watching Lights Out or Be it roaming on Kolkata's streets and getting followed by beggars. Be it just sitting in MBFM classes because nothing used to happen really :P You are the one person who was constant in this equation. Thanks for being there.

College would have incomplete without you given that you were a part of everyday I spent on campus( except 4-1 of course). And also hats off to your parents to have brought up a person so beautiful, smart, talented and also sweet, humble and completely(seemingly XD) unaware of how awesome she is.

While penning this piece, I realized that what I'd like to say here isn't too different from what I'd scrawled patiently and honestly in your birthday scrap book back in first year. I guess that just goes to show the kind of person you are: level-headed, friendly, and unaffected by all the success that you've deservedly achieved. And, of course it also means that you're still a Powerpuff, a gossip queen, and a flirtatious man-izer who makes the most of the looooong distance between Goa/Mumbai and KGP to have her fun on campus and at work. ;) Indra Nooyi bankar bhool mat jaana plis.

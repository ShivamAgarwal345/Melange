If you stop her and ask her - how are you? You'll find that most of the times she will reply saying - "chal toh rahi hu, theek hi hogi na." But she's nothing like she seems to be. And getting to know her may seem challenging because she won't make it easy for you but I can assure you it is worth it. She's a really good friend, an excellent listener, really really entertaining and someone who'd make you think a little more. She's the best writer I know of. I've shared really good times with her and its something I'd cherish forever. Love you arka. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Shreya Arya<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>My anime and k-pop buddy!

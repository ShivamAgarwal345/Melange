Those discussions on cinema will be remembered and also thanks for the movie recommendations you gave from the first year. Eagerly waiting to see a film(s) with your screenwriting (or direction) in near future. All the best for your future!!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Ameya Mangesh Deshpande<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>To the person with whom I can argue with for days and weeks together but never fight a single time. If I were given a choice to save only one of my friends and let all others die I would undoubtedly choose you. For I am sure that you are going to do much more for humanity than probably all of us combined would do. You are one of the most humble persons I have ever met. A man whose views are unimaginably different than the general opinion yet a man who would always listen to each view present. I wish that each and every person in the world would have your level of tolerance. I think that that itself would finish off all the hate crimes that have become so prevalent in today's world. I am sure that one day you would become one of the best directors this world has ever seen and I would be proud in telling my kids that this man was my neighbour in college. I hope you find all the answers that you are looking for so that you can finally come to peace with this dogmatic society. Our paths are going to diverge after college but one thing is for sure, whenever we meet I'll make sure that there is a game of cricket ;)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ANAND Dugad<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>The one guy who is always in the opposite team of very debate! The one quality which I most respect about you is that you have not accepted anything about anything because someone else has said it, you always have your independent line of thought for every small thing in the world! You are one the most well read people I have ever seen be it sports, politics or movies! Best of luck for your future! 15 years down the line we all shall discuss and prepare you for your Oscar speech!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Soham Kelkar<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Surprisingly, we seemed to be on the same side of any discussion and yet were completely different viewpoints. Arguing with you was an enthralling experience. It taught me more thanthe lectures in this college, maybe! From ridiculing Chirag to intense disucssions on films and worldly philosopohies to bashing the existing societal paradigms, Thank YOU for being the perfect blend of knowledge , experience and manners! We hope to see your film being the first to win an award in this commercialized cinematic world! ALL the BEST, from the biggest contributor to your film's profit! :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...VARAD JOSHI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>One of the closest friend I have. Even though are interests differ I like just listening to your line of thought. You have a very independent line of thought challenging each and every thing and not accepting things just like that. Movie recommendations are without a doubt always from you and it's no surprise that each and every movie you have recommended are a sheer bliss to watch. I will never forget our carrom matches which strengthened our bond even more so. It was only because of you started following politics and I am loving it. Cricket in pune and in Goa is incomplete without you. Waiting to see a film written by you. Ekda ali ki kalav majhya ghari baghu ;). All the best for your future.

You have an opinion on certain issues that differs from the general public. Also you have the gall to hold on to it! That's what I like about you. Also your fashion sense is excellent.

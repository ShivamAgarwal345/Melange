Answer: Be an extremely disciplined individual who is already blessed with the brains of a mathematical wizard. Be a fierce competitor who strives not only to improve himself but all others around him. Be the person who can always reason out things with logic and who never fails to be there for his friends (unless it is exam time - marks zyaada important he). But also be the one who keeps making sexist remarks and who keeps crying about everything he possibly can. And that's how you be a Murthy. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...RANAWAT CHIRAG DINESH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>I hope you shed a tear or two when you read this page and the beautiful things people have written about you.

You have been such a good partner that some *ahem ahem* one *ahem ahem* is extremely jealous of you. But kya karu, mujhe jo teri lat lag gayi hain vo itne aasani se nahi chutegi. I have argued, better word fought, with you so much without ever coming to a conclusion that I don't recollect any issue jaha apni bhais na hui ho. The only reason our debates ended was if either of us had to leave. But the way we put each argument past us and discussed more important points in life is one of a kind. We know how much WhatsApp chat history we have. There is only one person in my chat list close to that and vo bhi kaafi dur hain. If there is one person from whom I have tried to learn the maximum number of things it is you. Your discipline, the command you have over multiple languages, your mail writing skill, your sincerity, the way you can look at any situation from a completely (il)logical perspective keeping your emotions aside (I know you would say that you don't have emotions but I know you do and I have seen you almost on the verge of tears). I really do wish you take Georgia Tech so that I can have at least two more years you. Our fights are never going to reduce, neither in number nor in intensity, but neither is our friendship. I know you believe that you won't be in contact with a person once you move away from him but I also know that I won't lose contact with someone who is so dear to me. To let's see who triumphs whom.

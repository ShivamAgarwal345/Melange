We've been through all the thick and thins, taking other people's cases in order to let our "Delhi side" rule over us. From getting same GPAs till 3 decimal places, to acting like a retard on compre minus day 3, (not to forget the seasoning oregano incident) and how we started certain things for a lovely "husky" voice to sing with. PS-1 was fun too, watching all the GOT eps and hunting for people to sign for our attendance haha.

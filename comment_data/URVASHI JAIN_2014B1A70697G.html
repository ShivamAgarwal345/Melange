I feel comfortable in telling you just about anything and I'm going to remember our friendship forever :) I loved all those times creeping you out in college :p Forever in my winger dude ;) I'm really happy to have gotten to know you really well in college and you're a really super genuinely caring person :) Don't let anything trouble you ever, you mean too much to me. PS: I keep getting that nagging thought in my head which repeatedly tells me that I should have asked you out in college and competed with the tree.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...YASH MEHTA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>A big thank you for all your notes in Bio and CS - helped me graduate.

This Testimonial doesn't contain enough space to how much I can write about you and how much I Adore you and like you.  Mrs Subcoordinator, Our journey has not been anything short than a roller coaster ride. I still remember those "maine nahi katta" moments of yours from first year to like going on Cricket Feild during 2-1 FBI times. Going out with Me, Suneha, Tushar for Non-Alcoholic outings to nowadays only thing you care about is Smirnoff Green Apple :P  I literally don't know someone else soo much than I have known you in my life. Because of you I always used to be motivated and because of you half of my college memories are really good :)  You will be always the closest to my heart, my true friend no matter where you will be in the coming future. No matter whenever you call in future, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a missed call :P also Congrats, Aakhir mein tumko bhi koi mil gaya.

You are the most honest and genuinely caring person I know. Literally, I don't know anyone else who gives a recheck to get their extra marks reduced. Your notes and last minute discussions have always saved me in the exams. From going to Monginis before the Bio classes, calling first yearites kids and wondering just how dumb they are, considering the faculty kam padhi likhi, listening to your mime problems and sometimes weird future plans (Remember that ides of yours to open a special school similar to Germany), planning a startup (which we might do one day :P)....each of these moments have been really fun and special and are the best memories of college life. Thank you for everything. You are the best. I know you will do great in life so stop worrying so much.

Your receptive nature to almost any topic under the sun, is so inspiring and I always come out equipped with more knowledge after each of those discussions. It's really inspiring to see how you balance every aspect of your college life so well. It's sad that we couldn't bond very much but I am still thankful for the time we did actually spend, and they will surely remain with me. All the best for your future, which I know you will ace!

Don't forget our deal regarding your school - I'm looking forward to all that biogas;) Oh, and thanks for the creepily detailed visions of my future family life and advanced tips on being a good dad - not that I'm going to heed them, of course.

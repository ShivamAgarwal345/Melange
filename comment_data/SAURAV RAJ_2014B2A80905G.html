Thanks for listening to my greeks and nonsenses. Its said that "the privilege of friendship is to talk nonsense, and to have his nonsense respected" . Thanks for always helping me. Thanks for listening to "Aj se mai vegeterian and other similar stuffs". You never stop trying and this always brings out the best in you irrespective of the domain you choose. Thanks for everything and ya you are my best buddy . </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ATISH KUMAR SINHA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Bhai yar..

Workshop. That's where I knew you from first. Since I knew that you were grouped with Pujan, I knew you were doomed. Somehow that random guy from CH-2 started spending more time in CH-6 rather than his own hostel. I still remember those days when you'd sleep in my room around 1 and would stay till 4 and then at 4 you'd ask me to accompany you back to CH-2 coz you were scared. Well, guess what, I was Scared(er). Post Compre, we went to the library just to take random selfies and then I forgot my keys at the Basketball court. BC raat ko 2 bje post compre the campus felt spooky AF!! But there was no problem, I always had someone to accompany me. BTW, fun fact: The only time I've traveled to Vasco (or anyplace for that matter) without any objective was when I went there with you. We actually bonded the most when we both were trapped in hell for 2 months (Read: Angul). All those labs we've shared. I wouldn't ask for anyone else. You were and still are the best lab partner, friend and sometimes even a teacher that I could ever ask for. Jump to today. I was blank ki BC what should I write here?? I can't even frame our friendship into a paragraph. To put it all in a nutshell (**SO THAT BITSAA PEOPLE CAN PUT THIS ON YOUR PAGE**): Saurav Raj is that one friend that everyone always yearns for but never truly finds. He is the Krishna to my Sudama (Read: He'll help me financially when he's rich AF). You'll achieve great things in life bhai!! Never give up on your dreams, Keep sleeping....</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...MEHUL KAUSHIK<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Arre bhaaaiiiii!

Shouting your name out loud while passing through your room was my favourite past time :p but then you used to throw me out of your room.

We shared almost all of our classes and yet never became friends. This is probably going to be one of my biggest regrets in BITS. However PS ke 5 mahino mein unn 3 saalo ki bharpayi achchese kardi. You are one of the most amazing people I have met. You are probably the only one who could hold her own against constant taunts from the three of us without getting angry. I know that our friendship has been short but even in this short time you know most of my secrets and I know quite a few of yours. I can just sit with you talking and talking and completely lose track of time. I can never thank you enough for the anniversary poster, something which I call a completely selfless deed. I know that you will land up with an amazing RAship and a brilliant college for MS thereafter. There are so many more things to write and I have used backspace so much while writing this message because I can't mention those things on a public forum. I just wish that you remain happy whatever you do. Always remember that anytime you feel that you need to speak to someone, or are feeling low, need any suggestions, just want to get it all out, anything at all, I will always be just a phone call away.

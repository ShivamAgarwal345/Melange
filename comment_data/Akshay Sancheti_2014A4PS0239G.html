You are the one person who has been a positive constant in my life since the first day of campus. The career talks, our arguments on so many things :P, though we do not agree on most of the ways we want to live our lives, we have managed to respect each others' choices and keep our friendship intact. You know everything about me, good and bad and still, you have supported and been there for me always. I love you. You are the best bro in the world. I hope you get what you aspire to in your career and keep acing life :) Here's to more career discussions in future. PS: Get married soon, I want to dance at your wedding. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ADITI MAHESHWARI<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>One of the most genuinely nice person I have ever met. Those late night studies before exams, your interesting and entertaining life story sessions, your late entries to almost all the mech lectures, going in all the rooms and getting people to connect to AOE and much more will always stay in my memory. Like mech, AOE, frisbee and many other things, keep acing whatever you do. I am sure that you will get whatever you aspire in your life. Stay in touch. All the best!!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Ameya Mangesh Deshpande<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Aoe, frisbee,mech God.

Innumerable times have you been late for everything due to your... ahem ahem... you know! But on a serious note, you are the most thoroughly prepared guy I have ever met. You would go to any lengths to finish the textbook, notes and 3 different colored highlights in them before the exams. You have been my inspiration to study mech in the 3rd year despite changing the field. You are an all rounder in the true sense... Study, sports, bandi and you know!  Best of luck in your future endeavours aur kabhi call bhi kar liya kar. </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...RATHI SHIVAM NARENDRA<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Yo Sancheti, Coolest bro, mightiest god.

For me you are a perfect all-rounder. You are the undoubtedly the most hard-working among all my friends. I really admire your way of going to the depth and completely understanding whatever you are doing. Then may it be your Mechanical CDC's, humanities, AOE or even frisbee. I have never seen you do anything half-heartedly. I know that recently you have been very confused about what you want to do in future but I want you to know that I am sure you will ace whatever you decide to do and this is not blind faith, it is because I know your personality and the way you approach each single thing in life. Another thing that I admire about you (and am slightly envious too) is your relationship with Tejasvi. I am sure that 20 years down the line you are going to be one of the most successful people, in your professional as well as your personal life. No need to tell you to be in touch because I know you will be.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ANAND Dugad<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Akki God _/\_ You've been one of the oldest friends on campus and someone I always look up to when I need an example of being practical. Really admire how you break down every problem into simple solutions. I am certain you'll do great in life because of this logical perspective of yours. Good Luck :D</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...RANAWAT CHIRAG DINESH<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Akshay are the closest someone has ever gotten to beating me in any game - be it Frisbee, AoE, CS.

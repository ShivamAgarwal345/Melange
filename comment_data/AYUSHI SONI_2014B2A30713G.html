So basically my parents got me admitted into BITS only for two reasons : 1) Job (not very likely) 2) To make you laugh everytime you would rant about life . I have much more respect and affection for you than i can express. You are surely one of the gems i am taking back from this college :) All the best for all your future endeavours.

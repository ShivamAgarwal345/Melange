Sorry for not talking in the first semester, Wouldn't have survived the college without you man. We had the best of times together. Always up for Mongi chai. Our mutual hate for chai haters made our bond stronger. You were always there if I ever needed any help. We still don't have a winner in our FIFA matches.Let's decide that in our next meet. Rakesh Stanley always be the same cool and loving person, Bohat bakwaas kiya hai saath main. TAT and all, Omu time travel stories, thinking of random scenarios and solving them, random arguments and concluding nothing out of them will always be missed. Vision 2020 pakka.

I remember asking people around whether they are Chintan or not. Trust me man I never expected you to be Chintan XD  I still remember that you hugged me during the time of PS1, it felt really great. I am sorry for not writing this in a coherent note just like you did for me, but believe me this is because of the countless memories that we created together and how they keep coming back every now and then. You are one of those people who plan very beautifully and then execute marvelously. When it comes to money and finances " Mujhe na toh baaki naam sunai na dikhai dete hain, sirf ek insaan ka naan sunai deta hai C-H-I-N-T-A-N ". And yeah! we won the Bluechip Beatdown ultimately so we make a good team when it comes to convincing people :P  Plus the way you argue sometimes is just a thing of beauty. You are Tharoor in the true sense. Your puns are always on point and I hope that one day you do Pooja yaa koi Dooja :P But anyway it doesn't matter because the kind of amazing person you are it will be a privilege to be near you. I still want to go to a lot more movies with you, want to play a lot of AOE-II games or just like to hear your stance on my crazy what if questions. I want to keep seeing you more often so that I can talk more nonsense and can watch you contradicting me in every possible sense.

Morgan, you are the kindest person I know. The ever wise, the ever rational and logical, and the ever positive voice in every discussion. I have envied you and then learned from you. And then found out you are also very sensible and sentimental. I have laughed and cried in front of you, without shame. How you manage to do everything with that calm is forever a mystery to me. You may or may not have a place in the cupboard under the stairs in Prakhar's flat, you'll always have a place in my heart.

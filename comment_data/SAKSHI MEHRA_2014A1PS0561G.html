I really miss being able to talk and hang out with you everyday. We connected really quickly in third year but I regret not spending more time with you in out first and second year. But it was too much fun creeping out Suneha, playing pranks on Urvashi and Apeksha ( Jogw notes and soap-paint). Also, I'm glad you visited a part of the campus with me for the first time. Btw, I still remember how you jumped with the coffee in your hand vividly and how I lost pathetically to you in tug of war. And I must say, you are also one of the wittiest people I know. You can own pretty much anyone you want. And hearing you swear in Hindi is legit awesome. I look forward to our meet ups in the future. Stay this amazing always.

The good and happy memories that I share with you are just not worth being cherished, they are priceless and no amount of fights and arguments can ever overwrite them. You have been the pillar on which my college life has been built and I would hate for you to not be a part of my life outside college. Thanks for making college bearable. Thank you for all being the person you are. You would never know the number of lives you have touched in this college and being the selfless person you are, you will never accept how amazing a person you are. I look forward to many more fights, arguments, food outings, movies and everything else possible (good or bad) with you because no time spent with you can be a waste.

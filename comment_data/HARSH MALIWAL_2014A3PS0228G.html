<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Seems difficult trying to write something about a person like Maliwal. An absolute idiot to the outside world, but actually a person with profound knowledge and strong ability to introspect - Maliwal has always been the first person to encourage his peers selflessly, in their endeavours. Despite attaining top-notch posts and fulfilling his duties responsibly, he never let them get to him, which speaks volumes about his character. I wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavours.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Sanjeev Sripadraj Murthy<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>From a "below" average EEE student to the campus Vice President to the Placement coordinator, and now placed in an IT company. Can see a correlation between our college journey. As Sanjeev already mentioned, it's quite hard to describe and express about you in a few lines. Some of my favorites: abusing in the public, EMT lectures with Sarthak, SIngle, and George, NC laughter sessions with Kops, and many more. Thankful to you for helping with the SoP, and many other things. Most importantly, thank you for being a True Friend. :) It's a rarity to find people like you these days. Needless to say, we'll definitely always be in touch. Keep slaying, Maliwal. Good luck for your future ventures. ~ Bhai </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...Dhananjai Sharma<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Some things are better off as a letter.

A person who I can accurately describe as being similar to a coconut: as sweet from within as you are 'harsh' from outside. The quality I like about you the most is not your amazing vocabulary, probably the best among my friends, nor your frank nature, nor is it your seemigly infinite knowledge of books or your ability stand up to any authority. The quality I admire about you the most is your ability to care. You care about people whom no one cares about. There are people who want a post because they want power, there are some who want it so they can add a POR to their CV and some want it so that they can gain monetary benefits. You are one of the rare gems who wants a post because he wants to change stuff. And this I think is the reason you became the VP and the Placement Coordinator. I do not regret a single moment I spent campaigning for you. It has all been worth it. To others you might have been a useless VP (Maybe because of your no bullshit attitude or because you refused to suck up to them) but for me you have been the best VP this campus has ever seen and probably will ever see and this I'm saying not as a friend but as a ordinary student. I do wish that we remain in touch.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ANAND Dugad<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Thanks for Kazoo Katli and that chocolate (I still don't remember its name,) PS-2 roomies to hai hi hamesha k liye.

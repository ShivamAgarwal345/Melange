<table width='100%'><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>This guy is one of its kind ! On one side, he seems an insensitive and emotionless human being(:P), but on the other side, he is so damn helping. A guy driven absolutely by 100% logic and 0% emotion which also makes him a great leader. With his pretty good humour sense, a great English accent(which even Prof Nilak Datta has admired) and his ability to scientifically analyse work, he easily attract people to him. Our PS instructor was a huge fan of him. Anyway, Hari, keep in touch :) I hope you achieve that rich successful life you aspire for :)  Did you know that first yearites consider you as their god?</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Your voice still continues to haunt meâ?¦ â??You fuckheadâ?¦â??

Long time bro! I thought you are a silent guy when I met you in Controls. Little did I know back then that with his logical approach, and clear mindset, this dude would one day turn the tides of that coco meeting. From that day since, he has been unstoppable at BITS confession page too. NVIDIA workshop could not have happened without you..coz I would have never understood the requirements that guy was putting forth. You have a very bright future bro!

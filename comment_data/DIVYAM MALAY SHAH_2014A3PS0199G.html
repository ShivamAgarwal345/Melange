You have become a role model dude. I give your examples to juniors about how you took risks and did different things. I have learned a lot from you. We were poles aparts in the beginning. But you were always open to every point of view which made it easy to talk to  you about various topics like philosophy, films, politics and what not. You were my only moral support and friend during PS2. I was lucky to have a guy with similar  interests as mine in those 6 months. Those fun weekends (plays, movies, library hunting) will be missed. Thanks for motivating me to  take up coding, to always try new things and giving some great advises. Phodne toh tu wala hai, bas apne startup main naukri de dena!

I have not met anyone like you, to take on every aspect of life with so much courage and enthusiasm. We met in TYSF, and it sky rocketed from there. From poop jokes to most serious aspect of life, we have discussed it all. Not just that, I really look forward to discussing things with you and knowing your view on it. You're an amazing person, Prerna. I have not seen many people working so passionately like you. We made TYSF possible, and for that, you'll always be an extremely special person in my life, as it was something really close to my heart. Spending time with you is always fun, always. What I love a lot about our friendship is the mutual understanding and the respect we have for each other, as it's extremely rare in today's world.  Keep working hard, like you've always done. Keep up your spirits, and help me keep mine, whenever I will feel down. :P Keep up the same level of enthusiasm that you've always carried with whatever you do. With all this, with all your core abilities, you'll go a long way in life. And, one thing I know for sure is that down the line, we'll work together again, in making this world a better place to live. :)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...SIDDHANT RATHORE .<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>One of the happiest, most enthusiastic and fun loving spirit I have found in my life.

You were always there during all the tiring days of Nirmaan to cheer things up and make them easier. You are one hell of an organiser, and have proved it through JoGW.

And keep that principle of spending on things you love rather than things you can show off always with you. I have learnt a lot of things from you and your opinions. You are an important part of the best memories of my college life, JOGW. Your passion to do something good was my motivation factor every single time I was unsure about the work.

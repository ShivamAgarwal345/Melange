He is truly talented in making chalis, memes and posting the apt gifs. He makes friends and can adjust with the situations quite easily. I was right in choosing you for that Salolim trip with Rohan and Adya. You got along them really well and she told me later that you made her feel really comfortable. That's an awesome quality one can have! Anyways thanks for the wonderful memories, keep in touch! :) Wish you all the success in future!</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:right'>...ARCHA R I<tr><td colspan='2'><hr style='height:0;border-style:dotted;border-width:1px 0 0 0;border-color:#007700;'/></td></tr><tr><td style='width:100%;color:#000;'>Mime God!
